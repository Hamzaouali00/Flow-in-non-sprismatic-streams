# Flow-in-non-sprismatic-streams
this repository contains .py file that studies the hydraulic flow behavior of skewed, two-stage converging, and diverging channels.
with compiling the code, you have to enter the the characteristics of the channel including the slope, the local loss coefficient and the initial flow rate
the output will show you the height of water in a channel at the end and the start of the channel
